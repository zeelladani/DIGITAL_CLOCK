# DIGITAL_CLOCK
this is the project of the digital clock. this repository includes the ARDUINO CODE, material required list, circuit diagrams, etc...

how to connect all the components.


Wiring the Components:

**OLED Display:**
VCC to 5V on the Arduino
GND to GND on the Arduino
SCL to A5 on the Arduino
SDA to A4 on the Arduino


**DS1307 RTC Module:**
VCC to 5V on the Arduino
GND to GND on the Arduino
SDA to A4 on the Arduino
SCL to A5 on the Arduino


**Installing Libraries:**
RTClib for the RTC module
Adafruit SSD1306 for the OLED display
You can install these libraries via the Arduino IDE:

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for RTClib and Adafruit SSD1306 and install them.
